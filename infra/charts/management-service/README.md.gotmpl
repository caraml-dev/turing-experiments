## Introduction

This Helm chart installs [Management Service](https://github.com/gojek/xp/management-service) and all its dependencies in a Kubernetes cluster.

## Prerequisites

To use the charts here, [Helm](https://helm.sh/) must be configured for your
Kubernetes cluster. Setting up Kubernetes and Helm is outside the scope of
this README. Please refer to the Kubernetes and Helm documentation.

- **Helm 3.0+** – This chart was tested with Helm v3.7.1, but it is also expected to work with earlier Helm versions
- **Kubernetes 1.18+** – This chart was tested with GKE v1.20.x, but it's possible it works with earlier k8s versions too.

## Installation

### Add Helm repository

```sh
$ helm repo add xp https://turing-ml.github.io/charts
```

### Installing the chart

This command will install XP Management Service release named `management-service` in the `default` namespace.
Default chart values will be used for the installation:
```shell
$ helm install xp xp/management-service
```

You can (and most likely, should) override the default configuration with values suitable for your installation.
Refer to [Configuration](#configuration) section for the detailed description of available configuration keys.

You can also refer to [values.minimal.yaml](./values.minimal.yaml) to check a minimal configuration that needs
to be provided for XP Management Service installation.

### Uninstalling the chart

To uninstall `management-service` release:
```shell
$ helm uninstall management-service
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release,
except for postgresql PVC, those will have to be removed manually.

## Configuration

The following table lists the configurable parameters of the XP Management Service chart and their default values.
